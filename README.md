## Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple game of rock paper scissors made to test my JavaScript knowledge.
First part was to create the game mechanics and display the results in the console. Second part was to create the UI which involved making changes to the previous code. I learned a lot about functions and events during this project and I will definitely be going back to it once I learn more cause there's still a lot to improve. 

## What could be improved
* add start and end game buttons
* (DONE) change pick and score text to bold
